# Java Notes App
A java note app built to sync notes between a desktop and android device. It uses a php backend connected to a MySQL database to achieve this. The desktop part uses Java FXML. 

User passwords are hashed and actual note data is encrypted by the program for security purposes. 


* Desktop has all of the java desktop files.
* Android has all of the android files.
* Server contains the server file.
* Assets contains all assets (like images/sql files) used.
* Application Files contains all useable files that are produced such as the jar and apk files.
